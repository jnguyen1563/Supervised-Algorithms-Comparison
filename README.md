# Supervised Machine Learning Comparison

This project was done for the class COGS118A - Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms  

The objective of this project was the compare the relative performances of three mainstream supervised machine learning algorithms:  
    -Linear Support Vector Machine  
    -Decision Tree  
    -Random Forests  

<br>

Models were trained on three different datasets, all accessible from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository:  
    -[Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)  
    -[Abalone Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)  
    -[Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

Each model was tested with a variety of train tests splits from 20% Train / 80% Test, 50 / 50, and 80 / 20.  Furthermore each algorithm was trained with their respective optimized hyperparameteres via GridSearch.  

Project includes a report written in the style of popular machine learning conference, NeurIPS.
